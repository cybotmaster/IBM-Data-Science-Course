    "I would like to pick the topic of credit cards. This is because credit cards have been widely used. According to a report by Markets Insider in May 2020 (website link below), in recent years, there are more reports on fraudulent credit card transactions which can cost billion of dollars to cardholders, banks, and businesses. Fraud culprits are making use of different methods to steal credit card information. Hence, it will be important to spot fraudulent credit card transactions as soon as the transactions occur, so as to minimise damages to all stakeholders. \n",

    "1. In the use of credit cards, there is a possibility of fraudulent transactions occurring. This possibility has gained transactions in recent years as more and more people are using credit cards in their daily lives. However, there are some issues in identifying these fraudulent transactions. For example, most people only found that they fell victim to these frauds when they check their bank account balance. There is a need to uncover these frauds as soon as suspicious transactions are detected. \n",

    "Analytic Approach: This problem requires us to classify each transaction into 2 categories: non-fraudulent and fraudulent. Therefore, we will need to use a classification technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Requirements: In order to understand each transaction properly, it would be paramount to find out past transactions and sieve out those transactions that are fraudulent. Other information such as location of the transaction and the mode of transaction (NFC (near-field communication), physical card) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection: We will need to understand how the transaction data is stored and the time period of each data entry.We will need to know if the transaction data is accessible and if there are any restrictions pertaining to each dataset. It will be good to use descriptive statistics and data evaluation. This is to ensure that there will be useful data for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Understanding and Preparation: Here, we will need to evaluate the different variables/parameters of the data in order to better understand the transactions. A visualisation plot can be done to understand the data. For example, correlation can be checked back with the fraud transaction entry and the location of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling and Evaluation: Lastly, we can create a classification model and evaluate the outcome. We have to make changes accordingly until we get a suitable model. In this problem, we can evaluate using: (1) accuracy of the model, (2) confusion matrix and possibly (3) level of type 1/type 2 errors."
